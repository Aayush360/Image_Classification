# Image_Classification
In this project we have taken images of 20 random class labels (includes animals, birds and human) and trained it on Stochastic Gradient Descent. Prior to Trianing the model, various preprocessing on image has been done like rescaling, grayscaling. Also, for feture extraction, we have used HOG features from the image. To select the best model we have used Grid SearchCV and finally got a model with around 72% accuracy on the test image. Finally,  setting on the choice of hyperparameters we have deployed the model using Flask on Python anywhere. This is an end-to-end project though trained on a small set of samples.
